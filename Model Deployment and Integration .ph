Step 7: Model Deployment and Integration
Once you have trained your model (using the previously discussed Autoencoder as an example), you can deploy it within an IoT device monitoring system. For simplicity, we'll demonstrate how to save and load a trained model using TensorFlow/Keras.

from tensorflow.keras.models import model_from_json

# Assuming 'autoencoder' is your trained model from previous steps

# Serialize model to JSON
model_json = autoencoder.to_json()
with open("autoencoder_model.json", "w") as json_file:
    json_file.write(model_json)

# Serialize weights to HDF5
autoencoder.save_weights("autoencoder_model.h5")
print("Saved model to disk")

# Later, load the model
json_file = open('autoencoder_model.json', 'r')
loaded_model_json = json_file.read()
json_file.close()
loaded_model = model_from_json(loaded_model_json)

# Load weights into new model
loaded_model.load_weights("autoencoder_model.h5")
print("Loaded model from disk")
